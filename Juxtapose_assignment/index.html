<h1>The modernization of basketball</h1>
</div>


    
<div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 cell">      

<p>Basketball has changed incredibly since it was first invented in the late 1800s and the game itself has been constantly evolving from <strong>LeBron James'</strong> emphatic dunks and <strong>Steph Curry's</strong> smooth 3-pointers.</p>

<p> Another thing that has changed has been the structure of the basketball hoop. It was first just a wicker basket with no backboard. Then, to mount it to a wall, the backboard was introduced. This evolved into a free-standing basket whcih then became adjustable. Now, basketball hoops are made of medal rims and glass backboards. They're so advanced you can even mount a camera on top of it.</p>

<h3><strong>Carmelo Anthony Timeline</strong></h3> 

<p> I decided to do a timeline of Carmelo Anthony becuase he is my favorite NBA player and I loved when he was on the Knicks.</p>

<p> I had a Carmelo Anthony Jersey and saw him play at MSG a few times when I was younger. </p>
